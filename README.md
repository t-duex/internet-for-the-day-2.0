## Internet For The Day 2.0 - Built on Next.js and deployed with Vercel

Internet For The Day is evolving to use Next.js and Vercel deployments, as well as adding some new features. Next.js might be a little overboard for now, but hopefully it makes adding new things a lot simpler and the Vercel previews that come as part of PRs should make adding to the site a lot more robust.

Right now, this project isn't ready for primetime so the domain currently points to the old Internet For The Day site. Once enough features are added to 2.0 and it feels like it's in a good state, I'll switch the domain to point to this version instead.
