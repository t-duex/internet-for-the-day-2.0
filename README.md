## Internet For The Day 2.0 - Built on Next.js and deployed with Vercel

Internet For The Day is evolving to use Next.js and Vercel deployments, as well as adding some new features. Next.js might be a little overboard for now, but hopefully it makes adding new things a lot simpler and the Vercel previews that come as part of PRs should make adding to the site a lot more robust.
